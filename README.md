# Awesome-Visual-Tracking
This repository aims to collect awesome visual tracking works, including algorithms and benchmarks. The goal is to provide a platform (like an informal review) for researchers to conveniently follow recently published as well as previous literature in the tracking community. Please note that, this repository focuses on the so-called single object tracking, including both 2D and 3D tracking tasks.
